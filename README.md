# Graph-Tests

## Introduction

This repository will contain some infographics generation tryouts, mainly written in C++.

Works will be 2D or 3D (at least at first). Some may use ``OpenGL``, ``stb`` or other librairies. Every librairies will be included via a [conanfile](conan.io).

This ``README`` contains a list of objectives I'll try to rank by "difficulty", and their status will be updated. ``CMake`` will have one target for each objective.

All these tryouts are meant to help me learn about graphics generation and see what I'm able to do. Because learning is freaking cool, yo.

Feel free to message me with your own implementations !

## Objectives

### 2D objectives

|      Objective      | Status |                                      Comment |
|:--------------------|:------:|---------------------------------------------:|
| Gradient generation |   ✅   | Easy but cool, used to initialize the repo   |
| Random pattern      |   ✅   | Easy overall, struggled with a lil' segfault |
| Perlin noise        |   🔺   | Really buggy                                 |
| Fractal noise       |   ❌   | Must wait for Perlin to be fixed             |
| Simplex noise       |   ❌   | Must wait for Perlin to be fixed             |
